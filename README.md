## This project is about using MLFLOW for ML project lifecycle

# Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to leverage MLflow to streamline and enhance the machine learning lifecycle. By integrating MLflow into our workflow, I aim to :
1. Improve Experiment Tracking
2. Enhance Reproducibility
3. Simplify Model Management
4. Automate Model Deployment
5. Facilitate Collaboration and Scalability

By achieving these objectives, the project seeks to establish a robust, transparent, and efficient pipeline for developing, testing, and deploying machine learning models, ultimately reducing the time and effort required to move from experimentation to production.
